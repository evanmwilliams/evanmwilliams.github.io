Hello! I'm Evan and I'm a software developer at AWS working on [AWS HealthOmics](https://aws.amazon.com/healthomics/). I graduated from Cornell in 2024 with an MEng in CS and a BS in CS and ECE. As an undergrad I worked with [Adrian Sampson](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~asampson/) on compilers for hardware accelerators. I also TA'd for CS courses and was president of [Cornell Data Science](https://cornelldata.science/), a student-run project team on campus. 

I'm broadly interested in hardware/software co-design at the intersection of compilers, programming languages, and computer architecture. I like thinking about abstractions up-and-down the computing stack and how we can improve them to simplify today's most challenging problems. 

I'm always happy to chat! Feel free to reach out at evanw0405@gmail.com.
